# Image-Classification

This project is an image classification project that uses CLIP model for the embeddings and then using Fisher linear Discrimiant Analysis for the classification(FLDA), this project classifies 2 classes(Dogs - Cats).

Just for the setup all you need is to unzip the images folder that the CLIP model will work on and then run the project and you can test with the images that are in the repository.
